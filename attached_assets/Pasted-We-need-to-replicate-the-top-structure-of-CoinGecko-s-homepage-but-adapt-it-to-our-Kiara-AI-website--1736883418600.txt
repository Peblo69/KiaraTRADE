We need to replicate the top structure of CoinGeckoâ€™s homepage but adapt it to our Kiara AI website. But we keep the video and the open AI chat as they are now!  Hereâ€™s exactly how it should look and function:

ðŸ“Œ 1. Top Bar (Crypto Market Data Overview)
The top section should display real-time cryptocurrency data in a thin horizontal strip across the page.
Include the following key metrics:
Total Coins Listed (e.g., "Coins: 16,659")
Total Exchanges Listed (e.g., "Exchanges: 1,202")
Global Crypto Market Cap (e.g., "$3.51T â–² 4.6%")
24h Trading Volume (e.g., "$153.46B")
BTC Dominance (e.g., "BTC 54.7%")
ETH Dominance (e.g., "ETH 11.1%")
Gas Fees (e.g., "Gas: 6.5 GWEI")
These values should be dynamically fetched and updated in real time using API data.
The font should be clean and minimal, and it should have a small upward/downward arrow next to percentage changes to indicate movement (green for up, red for down).
ðŸ“Œ 2. Main Navigation Bar (Kiara Branding & Menus)
The main navigation bar should be sleek, modern, and aligned with Kiaraâ€™s futuristic theme.
The left side should have the Kiara logo with the name "Kiara AI" next to it.
The navigation menu should include:
Crypto Market (Dropdown: Prices, Market Trends, Top Gainers)
AI Assistant (Dropdown: Chat with Kiara, AI Tools, Premium Features)
Trading (Dropdown: Strategies, Wallet Integration, Automated Trading)
Learn (Dropdown: Crypto Basics, AI Guides, FAQ)
Products (Dropdown: Kiaraâ€™s Token, Partnerships, AI Services)
The font should be modern and futuristic, matching the AI aesthetic.
ðŸ“Œ 3. User Options (Login & Signup)
On the right side, there should be two buttons:
Login (White Button with Gray Border)
Sign Up (Bright Green Button)
These buttons should be the same size and style as CoinGeckoâ€™s, but fitted to our theme.
The Sign Up button should stand out more with a vibrant green color.
When logged in, these buttons should be replaced with a profile icon dropdown where users can manage their accounts.
ðŸ“Œ 4. Search Bar (Crypto & AI Assistant Search)
Next to the login/signup buttons, there should be a search bar where users can:
Search for crypto tokens and market data.
Search for Kiara AI features & answers (e.g., "What is Solana?", "How do I buy ETH?")
The search bar should have rounded corners and a subtle magnifying glass icon.
ðŸ“Œ 5. Light/Dark Mode Toggle & Settings
In the top-right corner, there should be:
A gear icon for settings.
A light/dark mode toggle switch (default: dark mode).
This should allow users to customize their experience while keeping a clean UI.
