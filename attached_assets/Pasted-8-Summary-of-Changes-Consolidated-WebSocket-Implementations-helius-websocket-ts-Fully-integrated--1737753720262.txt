8. Summary of Changes
Consolidated WebSocket Implementations:
helius-websocket.ts: Fully integrated Helius WebSocket to handle real-time token data and trades. Removed dependency on PumpPortal. Utilized Helius's WebSocket for subscribing to token account changes and processing incoming trade data.
Unified Token Store:
unified-token-store.ts: Centralized state management using Zustand to handle all token-related data, transactions, and connection statuses. This store now aggregates data from Helius and can be extended for future integrations.
Updated React Components:
pumpfun-vision.tsx: Modified to use the Unified Token Store, displaying tokens and their live trades. Integrated the AdvancedChart component to visualize price data.
AdvancedChart.tsx: Ensured compatibility with the new candleData structure for rendering candlestick charts using lightweight-charts.
Enhanced Data Handling:
Implemented comprehensive trade processing, including calculating trade impacts, updating token metrics, and storing trades in a backend database via Axios.
Integrated SOL price fetching and periodic updates to ensure accurate USD calculations.
WebSocket Connection Management:
Implemented robust connection handling with reconnection logic in both Helius WebSocket implementations.
Ensured subscriptions to token accounts are maintained across reconnections.
State Management Optimization:
Leveraged Zustand for efficient and centralized state updates, minimizing unnecessary re-renders and optimizing performance.
Security Enhancements:
Ensured that the Helius API key is securely integrated within the WebSocket URLs.
Added error handling and logging for better debugging and monitoring.
Performance Optimizations:
Implemented debouncing in WebSocket message handling to prevent performance bottlenecks during rapid data influx.
Limited the number of stored trades per token to maintain optimal performance.
UI Enhancements:
Improved the user interface with clear indicators for trade types (buy/sell) using icons and color coding.
Enhanced the AdvancedChart component for better visualization of token price movements.
