🚀 Project Page Design: Live PumpFun Token Feed

📌 Objective:
I want to add a "Live Token Tracker" section to the Project Page of my website. This section should dynamically display newly launched PumpFun tokens in real-time as they appear on the blockchain. The data must be fetched directly from the PumpFun WebSocket API and updated live without requiring a page refresh.

🔹 Features & Requirements
1️⃣ Real-Time Token Updates:

The website must subscribe to new token creation events from the PumpFun WebSocket API.
As soon as a token is created, it should instantly appear on the page.
2️⃣ Modern, Clean UI:

Tokens should be displayed in a card-style format, similar to trading websites like BullX, Photon, or Dexscreener.
Each token card should include:
Token Name & Symbol
Token Logo/Image
Current Market Cap (live updates)
Liquidity Added Status (if liquidity is detected)
Total Holders
24h Trading Volume
Live Price Chart (if possible)
Clickable Solscan Link for users to view token details on the blockchain
3️⃣ Smooth, Dynamic Display:

The latest tokens should always appear at the top as they are launched.
The UI should have a dark theme, smooth hover effects, and a mobile-friendly layout.
Animations & transitions should be added for a polished experience.
4️⃣ Fetching Additional Data:

Once a new token is detected, the system should fetch extra details such as:
Market Cap & Total Supply
Number of Holders
Price & Trading Volume
The data should be pulled from Solana RPC API, Solscan, or PumpFun API.
5️⃣ Professional, Trading-Style Layout:

Tokens should be arranged neatly in rows or a grid layout, making it easy for users to track new launches.
The design should resemble a real crypto tracking dashboard with overlays, charts, and clear token information.
💡 Example Sites for Inspiration:
Photon (Live token tracker with clean visuals)
BullX (Well-structured token card system)
DexScreener (Real-time crypto tracking UI)
📌 Final Goal:

The Project Page will include a Live Token Tracker that updates automatically with newly launched PumpFun tokens.
The UI will be sleek, modern, and real-time, making it engaging and visually appealing for users.
The system should function without requiring manual refresh, offering a seamless experience.
🔥 This feature will make my website competitive with top crypto tracking platforms while keeping it unique and highly interactive! 🚀
