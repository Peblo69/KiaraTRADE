1. Overview of the System Architecture
Your PumpFun Vision application is designed to provide real-time tracking and visualization of newly created tokens on the Solana blockchain. The system integrates data from two primary sources:

PumpPortal WebSocket: Streams live data about token creations and trade events.
Helius WebSocket: Monitors specific token-related events for additional insights.
To manage and process this data efficiently, the application utilizes a state management library (Zustand) to maintain the application's state, ensuring that updates are reflected seamlessly on the frontend.

2. Core Components and Their Roles
a. Data Fetching and Real-Time Updates
PumpPortal WebSocket Connection:

Purpose: Listens for real-time events such as token creations (create transactions) and trade activities (buy or sell transactions).
Functionality:
Token Creation Events: When a new token is created, the system fetches its initial details, including name, symbol, address, initial liquidity, and other pertinent metrics.
Trade Events: Monitors ongoing buy and sell activities for existing tokens, capturing details like trade volume, price impact, and trader information.
Helius WebSocket Connection:

Purpose: Subscribes to specific token events to gather more granular data or monitor particular activities related to the tokens.
Functionality: Receives notifications about account changes, program notifications, or other blockchain-related events that provide deeper insights into token behaviors.
b. State Management with Zustand
PumpPortal Store:
Purpose: Maintains the application's state, including the list of tracked tokens, their real-time metrics, and connection statuses.
Key Features:
Token Management: Adds new tokens to the state when they are created and updates existing tokens based on incoming trade events.
Real-Time Metrics: Tracks dynamic metrics such as price, market capitalization, liquidity, trade volumes, and recent trade histories.
Connection Status: Monitors the connection status of the PumpPortal WebSocket to handle reconnections and notify the frontend of connectivity issues.
c. Frontend Components
Token List View:

Purpose: Displays a list of all tracked tokens with their current metrics, allowing users to browse and select tokens of interest.
Features:
Real-Time Data Display: Reflects the latest token prices, market caps, liquidity, and trading volumes.
Interactive Elements: Enables users to click on a token to view more detailed information.
Token Detail View:

Purpose: Provides an in-depth look at a selected token, showcasing detailed statistics, historical data, and live trade feeds.
Features:
Price Charts: Placeholder for future implementation to visualize price movements over time.
Detailed Metrics: Displays comprehensive statistics such as market cap, liquidity, and volume across various timeframes.
Live Trades: Shows a live feed of recent buy and sell transactions, updating in real-time as new trades occur.
3. Enhanced Logic and Data Flow
a. Solana (SOL) Price Fetching
Objective: Accurately determine the current price of SOL in USD to calculate token valuations and market metrics.

Implementation:

API Integration: Utilizes the CoinGecko API to fetch the latest SOL price.
Caching Mechanism:
Purpose: Reduces the number of API calls by storing the fetched SOL price for a set duration (e.g., 30 seconds).
Functionality: Before making an API request, the system checks if a recent price is cached. If so, it uses the cached value; otherwise, it fetches a new price.
Error Handling:
Retries: Implements a retry mechanism with exponential backoff to handle transient network issues or API rate limits.
Fallbacks: If all retries fail, the system falls back to the last known SOL price or a predefined default value (e.g., $100) to ensure continuity.
Multiple Data Sources: Plans to incorporate additional APIs (e.g., Binance) as backup sources in case the primary API fails.
b. Token Creation and Management
New Token Detection:
Process: When a create transaction is detected via the PumpPortal WebSocket, the system extracts relevant token details.
Mapping Data:
Sol Price Dependency: Uses the current SOL price to calculate the token's initial market cap and liquidity in USD.
Default Values: Assigns default values (e.g., a placeholder image) if certain data points like imageLink are missing.
State Update: Adds the new token to the Zustand store, making it visible on the frontend's token list.
Subscriptions:
Helius Integration: Subscribes to the new token's address via the Helius WebSocket for additional monitoring.
Trade Events: Subscribes to trade events specific to the new token to receive real-time buy/sell updates.
c. Real-Time Trade Processing
Trade Event Handling:
Data Capture: Receives trade events indicating buys or sells, including details like trade volume, trader's wallet address, and transaction type.
Price Impact Calculation:
Logic: Adjusts the token's price based on the trade volume and liquidity, simulating market dynamics.
Effect: Larger trades relative to liquidity have a more significant impact on price, reflecting real-world market behavior.
Time Window Management:
Multiple Timeframes: Maintains statistics across various time windows (e.g., 1 minute, 5 minutes, 1 hour) to provide comprehensive metrics.
Window Resetting: Resets time windows if a significant price change occurs or if the window duration has elapsed, ensuring data remains relevant.
State Update: Updates the token's metrics in the Zustand store, ensuring that the frontend reflects the latest data instantly.
Recent Trades Maintenance: Keeps a rolling history of recent trades (e.g., the last 50 trades) to display in the live trades feed.
d. Image Handling and Preloading
Token Images:
Dynamic Loading: Attempts to load token-specific images using the provided imageLink. If unavailable or invalid, defaults to a placeholder image.
Preloading: Preloads images for tokens to enhance performance and reduce loading times on the frontend.
Error Handling: Implements error handlers to replace failed image loads with the placeholder, ensuring visual consistency.
e. Frontend Reactivity and User Interaction
State Subscription:
Zustand Store: Frontend components subscribe to the Zustand store to receive real-time updates without manual intervention.
Automatic Re-rendering: As the store updates (e.g., new trades or token metrics), React components automatically re-render to display the latest information.
User Interactions:
Token Selection: Users can click on a token from the list to view detailed information and live trade feeds.
Detail Navigation: The detail view overlays the main page, providing focused insights while maintaining context.
4. Robustness and Error Resilience Enhancements
a. Improved Error Handling
API Errors: Implements comprehensive error logging and fallback mechanisms to handle API request failures gracefully.
WebSocket Disconnections: Monitors WebSocket connections and attempts reconnections with defined strategies (e.g., limited retries with delays) to maintain data flow continuity.
Image Load Failures: Ensures that image loading failures do not disrupt the user interface by reverting to placeholder images.
b. Scalability and Performance Optimization
Data Limiting: Restricts the number of tokens tracked (e.g., the latest 10 tokens) to prevent performance degradation as the number of tokens grows.
Efficient State Updates: Optimizes state management to handle frequent updates (e.g., multiple trade events per second) without overwhelming the frontend.
Preloading Assets: Enhances user experience by preloading critical assets like images, reducing perceived load times.
5. Workflow Summary: From Data Ingestion to Frontend Display
Data Ingestion:

WebSockets: The system establishes WebSocket connections to PumpPortal and Helius to receive real-time token and trade data.
API Requests: Periodically fetches the current SOL price from CoinGecko (and potentially other sources) to calculate token valuations accurately.
Data Processing:

Token Creation: When a new token is detected, the system maps its initial metrics using the current SOL price and adds it to the state.
Trade Events: Processes incoming trade events to adjust token prices and update various metrics across multiple time windows.
State Management:
