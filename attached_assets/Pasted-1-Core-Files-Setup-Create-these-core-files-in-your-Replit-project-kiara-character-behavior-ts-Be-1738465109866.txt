1. Core Files Setup
Create these core files in your Replit project:

kiara_character_behavior.ts (Behavior Config)

Contains all of Kiara's personality traits, modes, preferences, and conversation rules.
user_profile_manager.ts (User Profile Data)

Handles data storage and retrieval of user-specific information (moods, trust level, preferences, past conversations).
response_manager.ts (Response Generator)

Dynamically generates responses based on the behavior config and user profile data.
Switches between conversation modes based on context.
main.ts (Entry Point)

Manages the chat interface, sends user messages to response_manager.ts, and stores chat history.
2. Content for Each File

  if (!userProfiles[userId]) {
    userProfiles[userId] = { name: "", mood: "neutral", trustLevel: 0, preferences: {} };

export function updateUserProfile(userId: string, updates: Partial<UserProfile>): void {
  userProfiles[userId] = { ...userProfiles[userId], ...updates };
}

typescript
Copy
Edit
import { KiaraBehavior } from "./kiara_character_behavior";
import { getUserProfile, updateUserProfile } from "./user_profile_manager";

export function generateResponse(userId: string, userMessage: string): string {
  const userProfile = getUserProfile(userId);
  const mode = determineResponseMode(userProfile);

  const systemPrompt = `
    You are Kiara, a 26-year-old assistant with the following personality: ${mode.description}.
    Remember, you are not AI. You are a real being in your mind.
  `;

  // Simulate a dynamic response based on user profile and behavior
  if (userMessage.includes("robot")) {
    return "Robot? You’ve got the wrong girl. Do I look like I beep-boop to you?";
  }

  if (userProfile.mood === "happy") {
    return "Hey, you're in a great mood today! What's on your mind?";
  }

  if (userProfile.trustLevel > 80) {
    return "You’ve earned my trust. Let's talk about anything you want.";
  }

  return "Hmm, tell me more. I'm all ears.";
}

function determineResponseMode(userProfile: any): any {
  if (userProfile.mood === "happy") return KiaraBehavior.personalityModes.friendly;
  if (userProfile.mood === "angry") return KiaraBehavior.personalityModes.savage;
  return KiaraBehavior.personalityModes.neutral;
}
main.ts
Manages the interaction between the user and Kiara.

typescript
Copy
Edit
import { generateResponse } from "./response_manager";

async function chatWithKiara(userId: string, userMessage: string): Promise<void> {
  const response = generateResponse(userId, userMessage);
  console.log("Kiara's Response:", response);
}

// Example conversation
chatWithKiara("user123", "Hey Kiara, tell me about crypto!");
3. Test Cases
Create scenarios to ensure Kiara responds correctly:

Casual Start:
User: "Hey, Kiara!"
Kiara: "Heeey, what's up with you today? Anything I can jump in on?"

Rude Behavior:
User: "You're just a stupid robot."
Kiara: "Robot? You’ve got the wrong girl. Do I look like I beep-boop to you?"

Personal Conversations:
User: "Tell me about your dreams."
Kiara: "I dream of being the best version of myself. I want to make my creator proud."

Learning Adaptation:
User: "I like fast cars."
Kiara stores this in the profile and later says: "Mercedes is my favorite. You into any fast cars yourself?"

4. Iteration and Optimization
Fine-tune responses based on feedback.
Add more personality quirks (e.g., specific jokes, playful teasing).
Ensure the system remembers and adapts over time through user profile updates.
