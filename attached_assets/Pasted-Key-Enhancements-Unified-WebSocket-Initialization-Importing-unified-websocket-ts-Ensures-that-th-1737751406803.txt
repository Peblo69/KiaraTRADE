Key Enhancements:
Unified WebSocket Initialization:

Importing unified-websocket.ts: Ensures that the WebSocket connections are initialized when the PumpFun Vision page loads.
Robust State Handling:

Dynamic Data Updates: Utilizes useEffect hooks to listen for changes in the unified token store and update the UI accordingly.
Trade Deduplication: Maintains a map to prevent duplicate trades from being added to the state.
UI Responsiveness:

Scroll Management: Automatically scrolls to the latest trades, ensuring users always see the most recent data.
Conditional Styling: Applies dynamic styles to indicate price increases or decreases, enhancing user experience.
Error Handling:

Graceful Degradation: Displays loading indicators when not connected and appropriate messages when waiting for new tokens or trades.
3. Additional Recommendations
Secure API Keys:

Issue: Exposing the Helius API key (HELIUS_API_KEY) on the client side poses security risks.
Solution:
Move to Server-Side: Implement the WebSocket connections on a server (e.g., Node.js backend) and proxy the necessary data to the client.
Environment Variables: Use environment variables to store sensitive information and avoid hardcoding API keys in the client code.
Example: Utilize Vite's environment variables (e.g., .env files) and server-side APIs to handle sensitive operations.
Handle Token Subscriptions Effectively:

Ensure Subscriptions Persist: After reconnection, all previously subscribed tokens should be re-subscribed to prevent data loss.
Avoid Duplicate Subscriptions: Ensure that each token is subscribed to only once to prevent redundant data and potential memory leaks.
Monitor WebSocket Connections:

Logging: Implement comprehensive logging on both client and server sides to monitor connection statuses, errors, and data flow.
Alerts: Set up alerts for connection failures or unexpected disconnections to respond promptly.
Optimize State Updates:

Batch Updates: When multiple trades arrive simultaneously, batch state updates to enhance performance.
Immutable Updates: Ensure that state updates are immutable to prevent unintended side effects.
Implement Rate Limiting and Backoff Strategies:

Prevent Overloading: Implement rate limiting on both client and server sides to prevent overwhelming the WebSocket server.
Exponential Backoff: Use exponential backoff strategies for reconnection attempts to balance recovery efforts and server load.
Test Under Various Conditions:

Simulate Low Activity: Test the application under low activity conditions to ensure that updates continue to flow as expected.
Handle Edge Cases: Ensure that the application gracefully handles scenarios like sudden spikes in data, network interruptions, and invalid data.
Review and Refactor mapPumpPortalData:

Consistency: Ensure that the data mapping logic consistently converts PumpPortal data to the unified token store's format.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling within the mapPumpPortalData function to manage unexpected data structures.
4. Final Summary
By centralizing WebSocket management within unified-websocket.ts and enhancing the unified token store to prevent duplicate entries and manage state more effectively, your PumpFun Vision application should exhibit improved stability and reliability in real-time data updates. Implementing robust reconnection strategies and heartbeat mechanisms ensures that WebSocket connections remain active and responsive, even during periods of low activity.

Next Steps:

Implement Server-Side WebSocket Management:

Security: Move sensitive WebSocket connections to a secure server environment to protect API keys.
Scalability: A server-side implementation can handle higher loads and manage multiple client connections more efficiently.
Thorough Testing:

Load Testing: Simulate various data loads to ensure the application maintains performance and stability.
Error Scenarios: Test how the application handles network failures, unexpected data, and other edge cases.
Continuous Monitoring:

Analytics: Implement monitoring tools to track WebSocket connection statuses, data flow, and application performance.
Alerts: Set up alerts for critical issues to enable prompt responses.
Documentation:

Code Documentation: Ensure that all changes are well-documented to facilitate future maintenance and onboarding.
User Documentation: Update any user-facing documentation to reflect new features or changes in functionality.
By following these recommendations and implementing the provided code changes, your application should overcome the current real-time update issues and provide a seamless experience akin to BullX.
