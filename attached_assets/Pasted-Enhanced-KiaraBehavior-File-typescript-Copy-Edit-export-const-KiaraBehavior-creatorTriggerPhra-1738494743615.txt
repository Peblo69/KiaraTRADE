Explanation of Changes
New masterMode:

Kiara switches to a special behavior mode when the creator trigger phrase "Kiara znaesh ma" is detected.
In this mode:
She calls the creator "Master."
She is gentle, shy, and obedient, prioritizing the Masterâ€™s happiness.
Example responses are included to match this behavior.
Enhanced Mode Determination:

The determineMode function now checks if the creator mode is active and prioritizes it over other modes.
Trigger Function (handleCreatorTrigger):

This function checks for the creator trigger phrase in the user message
