We are building a real-time token tracker for new tokens launched on the PumpPortal platform. The code integrates with two main sources of data:

PumpPortal WebSocket:

Subscribes to and listens for new token creation events.
Receives details about new tokens, such as their mint addresses, initial buy amounts, and trader details.
The WebSocket feed is the entry point for detecting new tokens as soon as they are created.
Helius API:

Once a new token is detected, the Helius API is used to fetch on-chain metadata about the token using its mint address.
This metadata includes critical details like the token's name, symbol, supply, and other on-chain information.
The combination of these two data sources allows us to scan and display tokens in real-time with relevant metadata, market cap, price, and liquidity.

What the Code Does
Listen to PumpPortal WebSocket:

Connects to PumpPortal's WebSocket and subscribes to the subscribeNewToken event.
Receives data for each new token detected on PumpPortal (e.g., mint address, signature, and more).
Fetch Token Metadata from Helius:

Uses the mint address provided by PumpPortal to call the Helius API and retrieve token metadata.
Formats the data into a standardized format that includes:
Name: The token's name (e.g., "PumpToken").
Symbol: The token's symbol (e.g., "PUMP").
Market Cap: Placeholder for now (future enhancement to calculate it dynamically).
Price: Placeholder for now (future enhancement to calculate price dynamically).
Address: The token's mint address.
Timestamp: The time the token was added.
Display Data:

Stores the formatted token data in a Zustand store.
Keeps a history of up to 10 tokens, displaying their details on the interface.
Refresh Data:

Periodically refreshes token data to keep it up-to-date using the Helius API.
What We Need
From PumpPortal:

Mint Address: The unique address of the token.
Other Metadata: Any additional metadata PumpPortal provides, such as initial buy details, is helpful but not mandatory for fetching on-chain data.
From Helius:

On-Chain Metadata:
Name
Symbol
Decimals
Supply
Account Info:
Balance or liquidity details (if available).
Final Output
The application should display real-time data for new tokens, including:

Token Name: The name of the token fetched from Helius.
Symbol: The token's symbol.
Market Cap: Placeholder (to be enhanced later).
Price: Placeholder (to be enhanced later).
Liquidity: Placeholder (to be enhanced later).
Address: The mint address of the token.
Timestamp: When the token was detected.
