1. Temporarily Remove/Comment Out the WebSocket Code
Comment out everything that connects to the WebSocket (both in your aggregator subscription and the front end).
Replace real data with static or fake data in your TokenChart or TokenTracker.
If the “maximum update depth exceeded” error disappears, you know the loop is triggered by your real-time WebSocket data. That means either:

The aggregator is spamming repeated messages (sending the same data over and over).
Your front end is sending some message back to the server (maybe via the store?), causing a loop.
Or each message from the aggregator is returning new references (like new objects) that cause your store’s selector to see “changed data” every time.
If the loop remains even with no WebSocket usage, look elsewhere (like a parent component or some other store).

2. Check If Your Aggregator Is Spamming the Same Message Repeatedly
Look at your aggregator (server) logs. Does it keep broadcasting the same token update over and over?

You might have code like:

js
Copy
broadcastUpdate(tokenAddress, tokenData);
in an event that fires continuously (like an on-chain subscription that sees the same state repeatedly).

If so, the front end receives each update, calls setState or useStore.setState, which triggers a re-render and possibly re-requests data, which triggers the aggregator to broadcast again—loop.

Fix: Only broadcast a token update if something actually changed. For instance, store the last known price or candle in the aggregator and compare. If it’s unchanged, don’t broadcast.

3. Check the Front End for a “Set State on Every Render” Pattern
Sometimes the front end has code like:

js
Copy
useEffect(() => {
  // Something triggers setState or store update unconditionally
  setState(...);
});
If that effect runs on every render with no proper dependency array or condition, you get infinite re-renders. Double-check your WebSocket code:

js
Copy
ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  // do we always call setState even if the data is identical?
};
Solution: Only update local state if the data is genuinely new/different. For example:

js
Copy
if (!deepEqual(newCandle, prevCandles[prevCandles.length - 1])) {
  setCandles([...prevCandles, newCandle]);
}
4. Confirm You Don’t Send a Message Back to the Server on Every Received Update
If your front end, upon receiving an update, does something like ws.send(...) to confirm or request something from the server, you can create a 2-way feedback loop:

Server → “Here’s an update” → Client → “OK got it, here’s something else” → Server → “Here’s an update”…

and so on. Make sure your client is purely reading messages, not re-sending data on each one (unless truly necessary).

5. Inspect the Store or “Unified Store” for Repeated State Updates
If you still use a global store (Zustand, Redux, etc.), see if reading or writing the store triggers new references each time. For example:

A store selector or getPriceHistory(tokenAddress) that always returns a new array or object.
This makes React think “the store changed” on every read → re-render → triggers the aggregator again (or triggers your front end logic to setState again).
How to Detect:

Add a subscribe in the store:

js
Copy
myStore.subscribe((newState) => {
  console.log('STORE UPDATED:', newState);
});
If you see continuous spam, something is rewriting the store in a loop.

If so, you must fix the store to only update or create new references when actual data changes, not every time the front end reads.

6. Make Sure DevTools Isn’t Amplifying the Issue
In rare cases, Zustand or Redux DevTools can re-trigger updates if the code is borderline. Temporarily turn off DevTools middleware if you’re using it:

js
Copy
// comment out devtools(...) or Redux devToolsEnhancer(...)
export const useStore = create((set, get) => ({
  ...
}));
If the loop goes away, you still have a real repeated update, but devtools was replaying or surfacing it more aggressively.

Summary: The 1-2-3 of Killing the Loop
Comment out the WebSocket to confirm the loop is from real-time updates.
Check aggregator → is it spamming the same update? If so, only broadcast changes.
Check front end → do we set state or store on every message, even if data is identical? If so, compare old vs. new data to skip no-op updates.
Those steps always reveal the culprit behind an infinite render loop in a real-time setup. Once you isolate the code path that triggers repeated updates, you can fix it by only updating state when real changes occur.
