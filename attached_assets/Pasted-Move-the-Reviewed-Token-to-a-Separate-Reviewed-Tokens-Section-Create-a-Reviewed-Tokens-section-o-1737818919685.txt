Move the Reviewed Token to a Separate "Reviewed Tokens" Section
Create a "Reviewed Tokens" section on the page where currently reviewed tokens are always displayed.
When a user clicks to review a token, move it to this separate section.
Steps:

Add a reviewedTokens state.
When a token is being reviewed, move it from the main list to the reviewed section.
Ensure the main list only displays non-reviewed tokens.

        tokens: {
          ...state.tokens,
          [address]: state.reviewedTokens[address],
        },
        reviewedTokens: Object.fromEntries(
          Object.entries(state.reviewedTokens).filter(([key]) => key !== address)
        ),
      }));
    }
  },

}));
Reviewed Tokens Section: Display tokens from reviewedTokens in a persistent section on the page.
Main List: The tokens list behaves as before, excluding tokens being reviewed.
3. Use a Virtualized List for Display
Instead of limiting the token list to 50, use a virtualized list (e.g., React Virtual or react-window) to display only visible tokens.
Tokens that aren’t visible on-screen don’t consume memory or DOM elements, so you can handle far more than 50 tokens efficiently.
Steps:

Render the list with virtualization to keep performance high.
Ensure that a token being reviewed is "locked" in place while being viewed, regardless of new tokens being added.
