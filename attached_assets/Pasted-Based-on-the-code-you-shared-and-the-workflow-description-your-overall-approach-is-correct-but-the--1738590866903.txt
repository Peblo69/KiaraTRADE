Based on the code you shared and the workflow description, your overall approach is correct—but the behavior you’re seeing (only token amounts stacking up while price remains 0) indicates that somewhere along the chain your price data isn’t coming through as expected. In other words, the candlestick generator is getting valid trade volumes (token amounts) but the price values (open, high, low, close) remain 0. Here are some points to check and some suggestions:

1. Verify the Trade Data
Trade Event Structure:
Your code expects each trade to have a nonzero priceInUsd. For example, in your store and candlestick generator you do:

ts
Copy
const prices = bucketTrades.map(t => t.priceInUsd || 0).filter(p => p > 0);
If every trade’s priceInUsd is 0 (or missing), then the generated candles will have open/high/low/close values of 0.

Action:
Check your WebSocket logs (the console logs in your store’s addTradeToHistory or updateTokenPrice functions) to ensure that each incoming trade has a valid, nonzero priceInUsd. If not, you may need to adjust how you compute the price from the raw trade data. For example, if you have the token amount and the SOL amount, you might derive a price (if that makes sense for your application).

2. Check the Calculation Function
calculatePumpFunTokenMetrics:
This function is responsible for calculating the token’s price and market cap from raw values (like vSolInBondingCurve and vTokensInBondingCurve).
Action: Verify that this function returns a nonzero value for price.usd when real trade events occur. If it’s returning 0, then the store will update the token with 0 for priceInUsd, and consequently, your candlestick generator will always use 0.
3. Validate the Candlestick Data
generateCandlestickData:
This helper groups trades into buckets and uses the trade’s priceInUsd values for open, high, low, and close.
Action: Add temporary logging inside generateCandlestickData (or in the useEffect in your TradingChart) to check what candle data is being produced. For example:
ts
Copy
console.log("Generated candles:", candleData);
If you see that all candle values (open, high, low, close) are 0, then the issue is upstream—likely that your trade events or token price updates aren’t providing a valid price.
4. Confirm the Data Flow
Your simplified data flow is:

WebSocket receives trade data → the PumpPortal store is updated (via addTradeToHistory and updateTokenPrice) → your main page (or a dedicated hook) uses generateCandlestickData to create candles → TradingChart consumes that candle data.
If the volume (derived from token amounts) is updating but the price remains 0, the chain is working for volumes but not for prices. So the focus should be on ensuring that priceInUsd is updated correctly in the store.

Suggestions to Fix the Issue
Log Incoming Trades:
In your PumpPortal store’s addTradeToHistory, log the tradeData.priceInUsd value. For example:

ts
Copy
console.log("Incoming trade priceInUsd:", tradeData.priceInUsd);
This will help you see if the WebSocket events contain a valid price.

Fallback Calculation (Optional):
If your trade events sometimes miss a valid priceInUsd value, you could compute a fallback price if you have enough data. For instance, if you know the SOL amount and token amount, you might do:

ts
Copy
const computedPrice = tradeData.tokenAmount > 0 ? tradeData.solAmount / tradeData.tokenAmount : 0;
(Make sure that this makes sense for your data—for example, that solAmount is already in USD, or if you need to convert it.)

Test with Known Data:
Temporarily inject a known, hardcoded trade (with a valid nonzero price) into the store and see if that updates the chart. This can help you isolate whether the problem is in data reception or in the chart rendering.

Final Check
If you see in your console that trade events are received with a valid price (nonzero) and that your store updates priceInUsd accordingly, then your candlestick data should be generated with nonzero values.
If, however, the price is always 0 even in the logs, then the issue is that your WebSocket events or your metrics calculation aren’t providing a real price
