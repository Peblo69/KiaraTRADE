What We Want to Achieve:
User Interaction:

Add a button in the trading view page of each token that says "Show Wallet Data."
When the button is clicked, it should fetch the required wallet information (Top Holders, Snipers, Insiders) for the currently displayed token.
Data Display:

Open a modal or side panel showing:
A list of Top 10% Holders (wallet addresses, their holdings, and percentage of total supply).
A list of Snipers (wallet addresses and their initial buy times).
A list of Insiders (wallet addresses and their transaction details with the dev wallet or significant profit patterns).
Each wallet should be clickable to view more details if needed (e.g., linking to a block explorer).
Data Calculation:

Use the Helius API to fetch token holder data, trade activity, and dev wallet interactions to compute:
Top 10% Holders based on the total token supply.
Snipers based on the first few trades after token creation.
Insiders based on interactions with the dev wallet (e.g., significant sells after large buys, frequent dev wallet trades).
Integration with Chart:

This functionality should integrate seamlessly into the existing token chart UI.
The chart and wallet data should both reflect the same token's data.

How It Should Work:
When the Button is Clicked:

Fetch data for the currently displayed token (using its mint address).
Fetch and process:
Top Holders: Use the /token-holders endpoint from Helius to get all token holders and calculate the top 10%.
Snipers: Use trade history from Helius or existing logic to identify wallets that purchased the token in the first few trades.
Insiders: Use trade data to detect wallets interacting frequently with the dev wallet or making significant profits.
Data Processing:

Top Holders:
Sort all holders by token balance in descending order.
Calculate cumulative token holdings until the total reaches 10% of the total supply.
Snipers:
Identify wallets that made trades within the first block or shortly after the token creation timestamp.

Insiders:
Check for frequent dev wallet interactions or large profit margins after buying from the dev wallet.
Store wallet interactions with timestamps and trade details.
Display the Data:

Show the data in a modal or side panel.
Categorize wallets into:
Top Holders
Snipers
Insiders
For each wallet, display:
Wallet address (formatted as abcd...1234).
Relevant metrics (e.g., balance, profit, transaction count).
Tags like "Sniper," "Insider," or "Top Holder" for easy identification.
Backend Workflow:

Use the Helius API for fetching token data:
/token-holders: To get all token holders.
/account-transactions: To identify trades and wallet interactions.
Use your existing trade tracking logic to enhance the data (e.g., identifying dev wallet interactions and snipers).
