This error occurs because the script "dev" is not defined in your package.json. Let's update your package.json to include all necessary scripts:

After updating your package.json, run:
bash

npm install

Now you can run any of these commands:

    npm run dev - Run the main application in development mode with hot reload
    npm run monitor - Run the token monitor
    npm run ws-monitor - Run the WebSocket monitor
    npm start - Run the built application
    npm run build - Build the application
    npm run test - Run tests

For your specific case, since you're trying to run in dev mode, use:
bash

npm run dev

Or if you want to run the monitor in dev mode:
bash

npm run dev:monitor

Or for the WebSocket monitor:
bash

npm run dev:ws

The error you're seeing is because the "dev" script wasn't defined in your package.json. This update adds all the necessary scripts and ensures they're properly configured for your application.

Make sure you have all the required files in your src directory:

    src/index.ts
    src/monitor.ts
    src/ws-monitor.ts
    src/test.ts
