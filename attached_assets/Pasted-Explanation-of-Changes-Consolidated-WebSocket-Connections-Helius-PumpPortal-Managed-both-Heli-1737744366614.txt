Explanation of Changes:

Consolidated WebSocket Connections:

Helius & PumpPortal: Managed both Helius and PumpPortal WebSocket connections within a single UnifiedWebSocket class to streamline connection management and prevent conflicts.
Heartbeat Mechanism for Helius:

Purpose: Ensures the Helius WebSocket connection remains alive by sending periodic ping messages and expecting pong responses.
Implementation:
startHeliusHeartbeat: Initiates the heartbeat interval.
resetHeliusHeartbeatTimeout: Resets the heartbeat timeout upon receiving a pong.
cleanupHeliusHeartbeat: Clears heartbeat intervals and timeouts during cleanup.
Increased MAX_RECONNECT_ATTEMPTS:

From: 5
To: 10
Reason: Enhances the persistence of reconnection attempts, increasing the chances of maintaining a stable connection.
Enhanced Reconnection Logic:

Exponential Backoff: Implements a reconnection delay that increases with each attempt to prevent overwhelming the server.
Separate Reconnect Attempts: Manages reconnection attempts separately for Helius and PumpPortal to ensure independent handling.
Error Handling Improvements:

Detailed Logging: Provides comprehensive error logs for easier debugging.
Graceful Failures: Ensures that the application doesn't crash upon encountering errors but attempts to recover gracefully.
Manual Disconnect Handling:

disconnect Method: Allows for graceful shutdown of all WebSocket connections, preventing unwanted reconnection attempts.
Security Considerations:

API Key Exposure: Important: Embedding your Helius API key directly into the client-side code exposes it publicly. Recommendation: Move the WebSocket connection logic to a secure server-side environment and proxy the data to the client. Alternatively, implement environment variables and server-side safeguards to protect the API key.
5. Recommendations and Final Steps
Protect Your Helius API Key:

Issue: Embedding the API key directly into client-side code (helius-websocket.ts and pump-portal-websocket.ts) exposes it publicly.
Solution: Move the WebSocket connection logic to a secure server-side environment (e.g., Node.js backend) and proxy the necessary data to the client. This approach prevents unauthorized access and misuse of your API key.
Review Backend API Endpoints:

Issue: Axios requests to /api/trades and other endpoints may fail if these endpoints are not correctly implemented or if there are CORS issues.
Solution:
Ensure that the backend endpoints (/api/trades, /api/solana/price, etc.) are correctly set up to handle requests from your frontend.
Implement proper CORS headers to allow requests from your frontend domain.
Secure your API endpoints to prevent unauthorized access.
Monitor and Debug WebSocket Connections:

Tools: Utilize browser developer tools and network monitoring to observe WebSocket frames and identify any anomalies or patterns leading to disconnections.
Logs: Keep detailed logs on both client and server sides to trace connection lifecycle events and errors.
Optimize SOL Price Fetching:

Issue: Frequent fetching of SOL price can lead to rate limiting or unnecessary load.
Solution:
Implement caching mechanisms to store SOL prices and update them at reasonable intervals.
Consider fetching SOL prices via your backend to centralize API requests and handle rate limiting more effectively.
Testing:

Simulate High Traffic: Test the WebSocket connections under high data influx to ensure stability.
Error Scenarios: Simulate network failures, server downtimes, and other error scenarios to verify the robustness of your reconnection logic.
Documentation and Code Maintenance:

Commenting: Ensure that all significant code blocks are well-commented to facilitate future maintenance and onboarding.
Documentation: Update your project documentation to reflect the new WebSocket integrations and any architectural changes.
Consider Using a Dedicated WebSocket Library:

Recommendation: Libraries like ReconnectingWebSocket or Sockette can simplify WebSocket management with built-in reconnection logic and other helpful features.
Summary of Actions Taken:
Vite Configuration:

Added polyfills for the buffer and process modules to resolve browser compatibility issues.
PumpPortal WebSocket:

Enhanced the SOL price fetching mechanism with robust error handling and retries.
Improved the WebSocket connection logic with exponential backoff and detailed logging.
Helius WebSocket:

Implemented a comprehensive heartbeat mechanism to maintain connection health.
Enhanced reconnection logic with increased maximum attempts and exponential backoff.
Unified WebSocket:

Consolidated both Helius and PumpPortal WebSocket connections into a single manager to streamline connection handling and prevent conflicts.
Security Recommendations:

Highlighted the importance of protecting the Helius API key and suggested moving WebSocket logic to the server side.
Final Recommendations:

Provided actionable steps to further secure, test, and optimize your WebSocket integrations.
By implementing these changes, your PumpFun Vision project should experience improved stability and performance in its WebSocket connections. Ensure that you follow the security recommendations to protect sensitive information and maintain the integrity of your application.
