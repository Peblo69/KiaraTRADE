Below is a concise, plain-English explanation you can give to the Replit AI (or any code-assisting AI) so it knows exactly what to do—and why. This basically instructs it to create one Replit project that has:

An Express/Node “aggregator” server that connects to PumpFun (and Helius if needed), stores candle/trade data in memory, and exposes both a REST endpoint and a WebSocket for real-time updates.

A React front end that fetches initial candle data from the server’s REST endpoint, then subscribes via WebSocket for new trades/candles. We keep the chart in local React state, so we avoid complex global stores and possible infinite loops.

Instructions to the AI:
1. Create a Node/Express Server as “Aggregator”

File: server.js (or index.js if that’s your preferred entry).

Install Dependencies:

express for HTTP/REST
ws or socket.io for WebSocket
Logic:

Connect to the PumpFun WebSocket (wss://pumpportal.fun/api/data).
Maintain an in-memory data structure (e.g., a simple const tokenCandles = {}) mapping tokenAddress → array of candle objects.
Each time we get a new trade from PumpFun, we figure out which candle it belongs to (based on timestamp & timeframe) and update or append a candle in tokenCandles[tokenAddress].
Broadcast the updated candle to all connected front-end clients through our server WebSocket.
REST Endpoint:

GET /api/tokens/:address/candles → returns the candle array for that token from our tokenCandles in memory.
WebSocket:

When a new trade arrives, after updating tokenCandles, we send a message like:
json
Copy
{
  "tokenAddress": "SoMeTokenAddress",
  "candle": { /* the updated or newly created candle */ }
}
All connected clients can read this and update their local state accordingly.
2. Serve the React Front End in the Same Project

We can have a client/ folder that contains a standard React app (Vite, CRA, Next.js—whatever you prefer).
In Replit, we typically run node server.js as our start script. That can:
Serve the compiled React files (if we build them to client/build/)
Or we can run them separately in dev.
3. React Code

In the TokenChart (or equivalent) component:
On mount, fetch('/api/tokens/' + tokenAddress + '/candles') → store data in local state.
Open a WebSocket to ws:// or wss:// your aggregator (the same server, just a different path/port).
On each message, if it’s for the current tokenAddress, we update our local candles array.
Render the chart from the candles in local state.
Why this avoids infinite loops:

The front end only updates state when a genuine new trade or candle arrives from the aggregator.
The aggregator does not keep re-triggering itself on every read; it only updates data on real PumpFun messages.
There’s no complicated store in React that can accidentally produce new references on each render.
The aggregator acts as the single source of truth, so we don’t have to fetch from PumpFun directly in each chart.
Short Rationale (Why We Do It This Way)
All aggregator logic (combining trades into candles, etc.) lives in one place: the Node server.
The front end is just a simple consumer of the aggregator’s data—one REST fetch for historical, plus a WebSocket for live updates.
This architecture is standard for real-time dashboards (like DexTools, Poocoin, etc.) because it scales better, is simpler to debug, and avoids React re-render loops that happen when the front end tries to do it all.
