Key Enhancements:
Centralized Connection Management:

Helius and PumpPortal: Both WebSocket connections are managed within the UnifiedWebSocket class, ensuring that they don't interfere with each other and are handled consistently.
Robust Reconnection Logic:

Exponential Backoff: Reconnection attempts increase the delay between each attempt, reducing server strain and improving the chances of successful reconnections.
Maximum Attempts: Increased the MAX_RECONNECT_ATTEMPTS to 10 for more persistent reconnections.
Heartbeat Mechanism:

Purpose: Sends periodic ping messages to both Helius and PumpPortal to keep connections alive and detect unresponsive connections.
Implementation:
startHeliusHeartbeat & startPumpPortalHeartbeat: Initiate heartbeat intervals.
resetHeliusHeartbeatTimeout & resetPumpPortalHeartbeatTimeout: Reset heartbeat timeouts upon receiving pong responses.
Timeout Handling: Closes the connection if a pong isn't received within the HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT.
Subscription Handling:

Resubscription on Reconnect: Upon reconnection, all previously subscribed tokens are re-subscribed to ensure continuous data flow.
Subscription Methods: subscribeHeliusToken manages subscriptions to Helius tokens.
Error Handling:

Detailed Logging: Provides comprehensive logs for connection events, errors, and trade processing to facilitate debugging.
Graceful Failures: Prevents the application from crashing by handling errors gracefully and attempting reconnections.
Token Data Mapping:

mapPumpPortalData: Converts PumpPortal data to the TokenData structure used in the unified token store.
preloadTokenImages: Preloads token images to enhance UI performance and handle image loading errors.
Manual Disconnect:

disconnect Method: Allows for a graceful shutdown of all WebSocket connections, preventing unwanted reconnection attempts.
3. Recommendations for Removing Redundant WebSocket Files
Action Required: To prevent conflicts and potential memory leaks, remove the separate helius-websocket.ts and pump-portal-websocket.ts files from your project. All WebSocket management is now handled within unified-websocket.ts.

Steps:

Delete the Following Files:

client/src/lib/helius-websocket.ts
client/src/lib/pump-portal-websocket.ts
Ensure No Imports Remain:

Search your project for any imports referencing the deleted files and remove or replace them with references to the unified store if necessary.
Update WebSocket Initialization:

Ensure that unified-websocket.ts is imported and initialized appropriately, preferably in your main application file or a high-level component to establish the connection as the app loads.
