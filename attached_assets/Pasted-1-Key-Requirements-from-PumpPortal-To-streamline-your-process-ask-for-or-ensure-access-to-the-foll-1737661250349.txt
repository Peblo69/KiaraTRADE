1. Key Requirements from PumpPortal
To streamline your process, ask for or ensure access to the following from PumpPortal:

A. Token-Specific Events/Endpoints
PumpPortal should provide an API or program logs that emit specific events for:

New Token Launches: Notifications when a new PumpFun token is created.
Liquidity Updates: Events or data when liquidity is added/removed.
Buy/Sell Transactions: Logs or details of token trades.
B. Program Metadata
Request or confirm:

Program ID: The unique identifier of PumpPortal’s Solana program.
This helps you filter relevant transactions and events.
Decoded Log Structure: The format of logs emitted by the program for buys, sells, liquidity, and other activities.
Example: Logs containing "addLiquidity", "buyToken", or "sellToken" identifiers.
C. Associated Accounts
Request details about:

Token Mint Accounts: The mint addresses for PumpFun tokens.
Liquidity Pool Accounts: Addresses or instructions to fetch data about token pairs (e.g., USDC/token).
Transaction History Access: Simplified access to historical data if required for analytics.
2. Data You Can Fetch with Helius + PumpPortal
With access to the above, you can use Helius to extract the following details for any PumpFun token in real time:

Market Cap (mcap):

Use the price per token (derived from liquidity pool swaps) and the fixed 1B supply:
Market Cap
=
Price Per Token
×
1
,
000
,
000
,
000
Market Cap=Price Per Token×1,000,000,000
Buys/Sells:

Decode transaction logs for buy and sell events. Use the Helius Transaction API to fetch and process these logs.
Liquidity:

Monitor liquidity pool updates using Helius’ WebSocket or Transaction API. Check for instructions like addLiquidity or pool state changes.
Price Updates:

Derive the price per token from liquidity pool transactions:
Price
=
USDC in Pool
Token in Pool
Price= 
Token in Pool
USDC in Pool
​
 
Volume/Activity:

Track the total number of buy/sell transactions over a given period.
3. Simplified Workflow
Here’s how to combine PumpPortal and Helius to achieve fast, detailed insights:

Step 1: Use Helius WebSocket for Real-Time Updates
Subscribe to PumpPortal’s program to capture:

New token launches.
Liquidity additions.
Buys/sells.
WebSocket Subscription Example:
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "logsSubscribe",
  "params": [
    {
      "mentions": ["6EF8rrecthR5Dkzon8Nwu78hRvfCKubJ14M5uBEwF6P"]  // PumpPortal Program ID
    },
    {
      "commitment": "confirmed"
    }
  ]
}
Step 2: Process Transaction Logs
Extract the signature of detected transactions from the WebSocket logs.
Use the Helius Transaction API to decode the transaction details:
javascript
Copy
Edit
const fetch = require('node-fetch');

async function fetchTransactionDetails(signature) {
    const url = `https://api.helius.xyz/v0/transactions/${signature}?api-key=YOUR_API_KEY`;
    const response = await fetch(url);
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
}
Decode logs for:
Buys/sells (track token transfers).
Liquidity updates (monitor addLiquidity or pool state changes).
Step 3: Derive Metrics
Use the transaction data to calculate:

Price: From liquidity pool swaps.
Market Cap: Using the fixed supply (1B).
Buys/Sells: By counting relevant token transfer instructions.
Liquidity: From liquidity pool state changes.
4. Ideal Information from PumpPortal
To maximize efficiency, request PumpPortal to:

Provide Clear Log Identifiers:

Standardize logs for events like addLiquidity, buyToken, and sellToken.
Include detailed transaction metadata in the logs (e.g., token mint, amounts, sender/receiver).
List All Active Tokens:

Provide an endpoint to fetch all current PumpFun token mints.
Simplify Liquidity Data Access:

Provide endpoints or logs that emit real-time liquidity pool states (e.g., USDC/token ratios).
Historical Data Support (Optional):

Allow access to past transactions for analytics or user-facing charts.
5. Example Full Data Flow
Real-Time Token Launch Detection:

Subscribe to the PumpPortal program using Helius WebSocket.
Parse logs to detect new token mints.
Real-Time Buys/Sells:

Use Helius WebSocket to detect token transfer events.
Fetch transaction details for decoding.
Market Metrics:

Derive price from liquidity pool transactions.
Calculate market cap using the fixed supply.
Frontend Updates:

Push data (mcap, buys, sells, liquidity) to Kiara Vision in real-time.
This setup ensures fast, detailed insights for any PumpFun token with minimal dependencies. Let me know if you need further help implementing this workflow!
