const TITLE = "About Us â€“ The Team Behind Kiara";
const CONTENT = `Welcome to Kiara, a project designed to redefine the way AI and crypto merge. We are a team of developers, blockchain enthusiasts, and visionaries dedicated to building the most advanced AI-driven crypto assistant the world has ever seen.

Our goal? To push AI beyond simple chatbot interactions and create a fully autonomous, intelligent, and adaptable assistant that transforms the way people navigate the crypto space.

Our Mission
In a world where markets move fast, scams are everywhere, and information is overwhelming, we believe AI should do more than just answer questionsâ€”it should learn, adapt, and act for you.

Kiara is designed to be:
âœ” A personalized AI crypto strategist â€“ Not just an assistant, but a real decision-making partner.
âœ” An AI-powered trading tool â€“ Providing real-time insights, tracking wallets, and automating research.
âœ” An evolving AI entity â€“ One that learns from the user and develops over time.
âœ” A Web3-integrated intelligence â€“ Bridging AI and blockchain like never before.

We aren't just building another crypto toolâ€”we are building the future of AI-powered market intelligence.`;

const VISION_CONTENT = `The Big Vision
Right now, Kiara is a powerful AI crypto assistant. But we are working on expanding her into a fully autonomous AI system that can:
âœ… Execute trades based on AI-powered research
âœ… Manage entire portfolios, optimizing strategies for maximum gains
âœ… Track real-time blockchain activity, detecting trends before anyone else
âœ… Integrate seamlessly into Web3, connecting with DeFi protocols, smart contracts, and wallets

This isn't just an AIâ€”it's the foundation for something much bigger.
